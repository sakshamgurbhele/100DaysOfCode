# 100DaysOfCode

#### Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode

Today I did study the topic "Big-O Notation" or Time Complexity, I learned about how Big-O notation is calculated and what are different types of time complexity for different Algorithms. I have solved some problems related to Big-O Notation (Time complexity) on Interview bit platform. 

#### Day 2 of #100DaysOfCode
I did Arrays today, Dynamic array or array list. I didn't did any question today realted to the topic. Learned about tags and code writing.

#### Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode
I resumed this challenge after a break of around 27 days, lol. anyways I revised Time complexity and Array, I did solve some questions on gfg. 
Did my hands dirty on Android Studio, build my first app yes the "Hello World" xd. and did little of apache cassandar database course on datastax e-learning.
