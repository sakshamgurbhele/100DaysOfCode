#### Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode

Today I did study the topic "Big-O Notation" or Time Complexity, I learned about how Big-O notation is calculated and what are different types of time complexity for different Algorithms. I have solved some problems related to Big-O Notation (Time complexity) on Interview bit platform.
